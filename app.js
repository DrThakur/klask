/*
1.When we use const keyword to create a varaible it basically creates a constant whose value cannot be changed throughout the program.
2.When we declare a varible using const keyword , we must intialise the value of varible in the same line or we should say simultaneously. We can't intialise varibles value declared using const keyword in the next line otherwise it wil throw error.

These restrictions are only for varible declared using const keyword and not on varibles declared using let keyword.
